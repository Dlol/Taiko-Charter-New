# Taiko-Charter-New
New version of my taiko charter

The old version is still available on my discord but you dont want to go there (it's also archived)
The two projects are not at full feature parity as this one needs a metadata editor, but when that's done, i'll still work on it :)

## TODO:
- Metadata Editor
- Music
- Better UI
- ✨ ***dark mode*** ✨
- Saving & Loading

## BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:
Make sure you have Git and nodejs installed
- Download the source code
> if you are just doing it for the web build thats great! just open index.html in your browser, otherwise continue
- Run `npm i` in the directory of the code
- Run `npm run start` and if you get any errors, install the packages it says it needs (or restart if you already have them)
- Run `npm run-script build`
- The final binary should be in the `out/taiko-charter-new-{os-arch}` directory!
> for linux useres in the `out/build` directory there should be .deb and .rpm packages if you'd like
